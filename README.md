Modtable
========

This repository contains STL files for building a 100% 3d printed table.
Assembly required.

### Why

I've been wanting a 3d printer for a long time. I finally decided to buy a 3d
printer after realizing that I could simply go and do that. I **could** go to a
store and purchase a table and be done with it.

Or I could make a table. I found this project:

https://www.printables.com/model/177153-modular-table-100-printed/files

I like the concept, but I want rods to have the same thickness as connectors. I
could accept it as-is and move on.

I decided to, instead, take the easy path and learn TinkerCAD in order to create
the pieces that I want.

This design deviates from the inspiration in the following ways:

* Rods are the same exterior thickness as the connectors. The resulting table is
  smooth (at a distance), minus the connection points. Unfortunately, this
  comes at the cost of requiring base plate support. Without base plate support,
  the connectors will sag downward during the print and fail.

* Connector boxes have four holes to connect with instead of two. As a result, a
  corner piece for the top will work for the bottom.

* Rods and connectors of this design are made to fit tighter than the original.

* Rods and connectors of this design are not compatible with the original.

### Miscellaneous

I have only tested this using PLA and a printer with a 0.40 mm nozzle.

I've designed the connectors to fit tight, so it's somewhat tricky to disconnect
them.

I have no idea how much tables built using these rods and connectors can
support.

This takes a long time to print. You're going to want to make batches.
